# TextToImage
Descriptions for GANs

In this work we are interested in translating text in the form of single-sentence human-written descriptions directly into image pixels. For example, “this small bird has a short, pointy orange beak and white belly” or ”the petals of this flower are pink and the anthers are yellow”. The problem of generating images from visual descriptions gained interest in the research community, but it is far from being solved.
To solve this challenging problem requires solving two subproblems: first, learn a text feature representation that captures the important visual details; and second, use these features to synthesize a compelling image that a human might mistake for real. Fortunately, deep learning has enabled enormous progress in both subproblems - natural language representation and image synthesis - in the previous several years, and we build on this for our current task.
